   | Delivery | Description                                            |
   | Status   |                                                        |
   | Code     |                                                        |
   +----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
   | 1.0      | The scheduling message is pending. i.e. the server is  |
   |          | still in the process of sending the message.  The      |
   |          | status code value can be expected to change once the   |
   |          | server has completed its sending and delivery          |
   |          | attempts.                                              |
   |          |                                                        |
   | 1.1      | The scheduling message has been successfully sent.     |
   |          | However, the server does not have explicit information |
   |          | about whether the scheduling message was successfully  |
   |          | delivered to the recipient.  This state can occur with |
   |          | "store and forward" style scheduling protocols such as |
   |          | iMIP [RFC2447] (iTIP using email).                     |
   |          |                                                        |
   | 1.2      | The scheduling message has been successfully           |
   |          | delivered.                                             |
   |          |                                                        |
   | 3.7      | The scheduling message was not delivered because the   |
   |          | server did not recognize the calendar user address of  |
   |          | the recipient as being a supported URI.                |
   |          |                                                        |
   | 3.8      | The scheduling message was not delivered because       |
   |          | access privileges do not allow it.                     |
   |          |                                                        |
   | 5.1      | The scheduling message was not delivered because the   |
   |          | server could not complete delivery of the message.     |
   |          | This is likely due to a temporary failure, and the     |
   |          | originator can try to send the message again at a      |
   |          | later time.                                            |
   |          |                                                        |
   | 5.2      | The scheduling message was not delivered because the   |
   |          | server was not able to find a suitable way to deliver  |
   |          | the message.  This is likely a permanent failure, and  |
   |          | the originator should not try to send the message      |
   |          | again, at least without verifying/correcting the       |
   |          | calendar user address of the recipient.                |
   |          |                                                        |
   | 5.3      | The scheduling message was not delivered and was       |
   |          | rejected because scheduling with that recipient is not |
   |          | allowed.  This is likely a permanent failure, and the  |
   |          | originator should not try to send the message again.   |
